# ðŸ›° Orbital - Video File Browser

Orbital is a local-first desktop app that allows you to search, filter, and preview video (and image) files on your computer. It turns your computer's file browser into YouTube.

Orbital is available to ðŸ‘‰ [purchase on Gumroad](https://suboptimaleng.gumroad.com/l/orbital-app) for $10 USD. All love (hate, questions, and suggestions) can be directed to me on Twitter ðŸ‘‰ [@SuboptimalEng](https://www.twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).
