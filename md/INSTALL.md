# Mac OS Installation Guide

- Download the .dmg file from Gumroad and click it to open. You should see a screen that shows the Orbital logo along with your applications folder.

- When you click on Orbital, you will see this popup that looks similar to this. The reason this happens is because I did not buy an Apple Developer License yet. (Details in FAQ).

- Anyway, you can press "ok" to close that popup, and head over to System Preferences > Security & Privacy.

- In here, you should see the option to "open (Orbital) anyway". You will need to press this the first time you download the app. This will open the app, but hold your horses, you aren't finished yet!

- Head back to this screen and drag the Orbital icon into the Applications folder. From now on, you should be able to easily open and close Orbital from your desktop without any popups.
